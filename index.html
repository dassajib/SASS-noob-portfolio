                How Long Does It Take to Be a Web Developer. It takes around 5 to 6 months to learn web development from
                scratch. This is if you spend a few hours studying every day. Some people learn in just a few months.

                <h2>Front End Development</h2>
                <h3>While there are many different types of technologies and stacks, most front-end web developers use
                    HTML,CSS and JavaScript, the de facto building blocks of the web, and client-side frameworks such as
                    Angular,React, Stencil and Vue.Not everything happens on the frontend, though. Client-side rendered
                    applications still rely on services and APIs that run on back-end remote servers or the cloud.
                </h3>
            </div>
            <div id="devlop" class="dev">
                <h2>Back End Development</h2>
                <h3>When back-end developers create apps that render on the server-side, they use
                    the same building
                    blocks as front-end developers: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.Back-end developers also work with software
                    stacks that include operating systems, web servers, frameworks, languages, programming APIs and
                    more. The
                    frameworks, languages and programming APIs in these stacks are used to render server-side sites and
                    web applications and to create services that other applications can consume.Notorious stacks include
                    .NET, MEAN and LAMP, but there are many more, and each includes a programming language of choice,
                    suchzas C#, JavaScript, Java, Go, Python or PHP.
